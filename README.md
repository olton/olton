## I'm Serhii Pimenov and I'm a Web Developer from Ukraine

Hi! My name is Serhii Pimenov. I am a Web Developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I'm passionate and dedicated to my work. 
I have more than 20 years of experience as a programmer and over 10 years of experience as a professional web developer. 

I enjoy every step of the design process, from discussion and collaboration to concept and execution, but I find the most satisfaction in seeing the finished product do everything for you that it was created to do. 

At this time I specialize in creating web components with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Also, I'm working on EasyTest â€” a light test framework for JS and TS.
